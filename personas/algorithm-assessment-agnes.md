# Algorithm Assessment Agnes

<img alt="Headshot of Agnes" src="./images/image2.png" width="300">

- **Age**: 35

- **Education**
  - BA in political science
    - took some math-heavy economics and research courses, intro CS
    - probably did an internship at a think tank working as an analyst.
  - Afterwards got an MS Data Science.

- **Professional Experience**
  - After getting her degree at 26, she spent three years 
    working as a data scientist to help some company 
    maximize its paperclip output

    - That role -- and the entire team she was on --
      existed primarily so higher-ups
      could say that they're "data-driven",
      when in fact no one ever read any of the reports they produced
      or ran any of the models after the demo.

  - Maybe worked at a startup coercing data 
    into looking sort of like a hockey stick.
      
    - While her previous job doing nothing 
      of consequence was unpleasant,
      lying to people was worse.
      After one year, she left.

- **Organizational Home** & **Foundational experience in practice**

  For the past 6 years, Agnes has been Working at SAIftee, 
  a [B Corp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_corporation)
<!-- ^^^^^^ Sort of a compromise between for-profit and non-profit -->
  with the mission of reducing AI harm
  by working with system developers 
  to identify and mitigate risks.

- **Engineering Capacities**:
  Knows Python, PyTorch, some visualization libraries,
  and data engineering stuff like Spark.
  Uses Jupyter Notebooks a lot.

- **Attentiveness to task**
  - If she chose to use the tool,
    then she's probably going to be highly attentive
    and play around a bunch with the parameters.

  - If she's pressured to use the tool by someone else,
    then she's probably going to be slightly--moderately inattentive,
    only going down the most obvious path of actions.

- **Customers**
  - ML Startups like Pymetrics who need 
    to develop trust in their core product.

  - Big companies that use AI somewhere in the business pipeline
    and want to advertise at responsible AI conferences.

- **Stakeholders**
  - The organization Agnes works for (Saiftee)
  - The organization that they're auditing
    - The engineers of the system
    - The manager in charge of the project
  - The users and useds of the system
    - Some systems have "useds" in addition to users.
      For instance, in an automated system for hiring,
      the user is the hiring managers
      and the useds are the candidates.

- **Relationship with risks that are surfaced -- 
  what does she do with them now, what would she ideally do?**

  Probably she writes a report detailing the problem,
  and its potential mitigations paths
  and gives it to somebody at the company, who skims it,
  then either...

  - ...misrepresents what is it says
    to support doing whatever they planned to do anyway.

  - ...ignores the core issues it points out
    but maybe picks out one specific example
    intended to illustrate a general problem
    and changes some small details so that the specific example
    no longer occurs and they can say that they "fixed it."

  Ideally, she would be involved early enough
  that issues could be addressed in time 
  to make more than surface-level changes.
